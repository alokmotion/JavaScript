#alert() in JavaScript
The alert() function in JavaScript allows us to display any message or warning in a browser window. It is often used to convey important information to users. Whenever alert() is used, an alert box pops up in a browser window, and the browser loses its focus on the current window. The users are forced to click the "OK" button on the alert box if they wish to continue browsing the current window.
